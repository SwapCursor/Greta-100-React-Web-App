# Instructions for Logging Issues

## 1. Read the README

Please [read the README](https://github.com/erikswed/Greta-100-React-Web-App/blob/master/README.md) before logging new issues, even if you think you have found a bug.

Issues that ask questions answered in the README will be closed without elaboration.

## 2. Search for Duplicates

[Search the existing issues](https://github.com/erikswed/Greta-100-React-Web-App/issues) before logging a new one.

## 3. Did you find a bug?

When logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:
 * What version of library you're using
 * If at all possible, an *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior
 * The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior

## 4. Do you have a suggestion?

We also accept suggestions in the issue tracker.
Be sure to [check the README](https://github.com/erikswed/Greta-100-React-Web-App/blob/master/README.md) first.

In general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:
* A description of the problem you're trying to solve
* An overview of the suggested solution
* Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places
  * Code examples showing e.g. "this would be an error, this wouldn't"
* If relevant, precedent in other libraries can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior

# Instructions for Contributing Code

## Contributing bug fixes

React file viewer is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking associated with it in [issues list](https://github.com/erikswed/Greta-100-React-Web-App/issues). Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

## Contributing features

Features (things that add new or improved functionality) may be accepted, but will need to first be reviewed and approved by a [team member](https://github.com/erikswed/Greta-100-React-Web-App/blob/master/AUTHORS.md).

## Housekeeping

Your pull request should: 

* Include a description of what your change intends to do
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch 
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* Make sure tests pass on the pull request
* Have clear commit messages 
    * e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
* Follow the code conventions in the code
