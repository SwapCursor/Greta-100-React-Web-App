## Requirements 
A website for Greta Thunberg Fridays For Future and for Greta's different engagements like award ceremonies, nominations, events and personal happenings. Practically everything about her journey. Greta Thunbergs concept is to every Friday make a protest outside or indoor to let the world know about the climate and ecological crisis. One particularly important thing is the weeks. Greta is now as-of writing on her 106'th week of protesting. By highlighting the "week" as a central organizer Fridays For Future have created their own time calendar era with week ONE on August 20 2018.
